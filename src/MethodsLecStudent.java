    represents how many of the item they would like to order. Display a new
    message using these arguments.

//  RECURSION

/*
    BONUS: Take a look at the Fibonacci sequence. Write a
    recursive method that accepts an int argument representing the number
    or results printed out following the Fibonacci sequence.

    For example:

    fibonacci(5) would print -> 0 1 1 2 3
    fibonacci(10) would print -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
 */

// HINT: The recursive method should return an int for each number in the series

// HINT: you may need an additional method using a for loop to actually print
// each number. This is the one you'll call in your main()
}
